Generally speaking, activities that can be completed quickly are worth higher points because it means that the player has played the game in the last hour or so.

Completing an Activity Check . | Record the date that you are performing the check in Column A. | For Columns B and C, you should notice that there is a dropdown available. It’s much easier to go through the neighborhood member listing than it is to copy and paste from the spreadsheet. That’s because it’s often easier to go in order up and down the list than it is to hunt and peck. As a result, in the game, click on the neighborhood house and record each member’s name from top to bottom. | Now the hard part: Check each neighbor for activity. Click on each neighbor and try to find the highest-point activity. Start by giving each member who has participated in the last derby with a participation check. After that, remember that crops must be in the process of growing (not fully mature), livestock should be walking around (not ready to be gathered), etc. | Repeat the process for each member, only marking their farm as inactive if you cannot find any sign of activity. Some common long-term activities to check: Jam Maker and Smelters are often working for players that may be sleeping overnight. | Once you are complete, record members who you marked as “inactive” and report it in the “Activity Tracking” discord channel. | .

Staying silent for the entire week only to come alive in the last 6 hours of a derby won’t help you and it won’t help us. Let us know you need help or if you can’t play due to something going on in your life. Real Life is more important than a game but we can’t read your mind. | Derby Participation is required at least once every two months: We don’t expect everyone to participate in every derby. But if you do, please read the Derby Rules before opting in. The elders perform a Full Opt-Out every Monday so you must opt in each derby. | Derby is for rewards, not for ladder climbers: We’ve been in the Champions League for some time now. We strive to finish in the top 3, but we aren’t in it to climb the leaderboard. While we are dedicated to the derby, we’re not going to push ourselves to climb higher and higher up the ranks. | Playing the game is required: We perform activity checks regularly. Inactive players may get kicked from the neighborhood if they are inactive for too long. If you are traveling or you just need a break, let us know and we’ll hold your spot.
