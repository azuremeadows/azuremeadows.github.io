Since each derby type has it's own set of quirks, these rules are applied generally.

# General Rules

1. All participating members must complete all tasks.  If a member fails to complete a task, they can make it up by either using their "Reactivate Derby Task" Farm Pass perk or by buying an extra task.
2. Participants are expected to take 320-point tasks, or their highest point equivalent.  Some derbies (such as the Blossom Derby) have tasks that are higher while others have lower point tasks.  If you accidently take a task under 320 points, please let us know in our Discord server or in game chat.  We know that mistakes happen, but we don't expect it to be the norm.  If the elders notice you taking multiple tasks under 320-points in one derby or taking one task under 320-points two derbies in a row, it will be counted against you.
