Since this is the Bingo Derby, derby participants must coordinate to get 'BINGO' on the Bingo board by completing tasks that are in a row.

Below is this week's bingo board.  The highlighted sections refer to the tasks that we are aiming to complete.  Be sure to prioritize these tasks in addition to only taking 320-point tasks.

Participants may select tasks that are less than 320-points so long as they are highlighted in the image above.  All other tasks must be 320-tasks.
