title: Derby Trash List - Proposed
parent: Derbies
nav_order: 99

**Note:** The following is a proposed trash list.  If there are no objections, the first derby that will follow this trash list would be December 6, 2022.

Since each derby type has it's own set of quirks, this page lists tasks that are generally trashed.  If there are events or if the derby type requires the completion of a task noted below, the elders will make this announcement in the Discord server.

- Any task that is less than 320 points
- Items that take longer than 4 hours to produce (e.g. Tomatoes, Strawberries, etc)
- Goods produced on machines (e.g. pies, juice, bread, smoothies)
- "Picnic Basket" tasks where more than one activity must be performed, with the exception of Town Visitor Baskets (e.g. serve 5 of each Teacher, Grand Master, Local)
- Fishing Tasks
- Tasks that remain on the board for 24 hours

To keep the board diverse with different tasks, we'll limit the following to just one task on the board:
- Boat Tasks
- Truck Delivery Tasks

Some derbies require us to coordinate our actions so be sure to look out for that.

Neighbors are strongly encouraged to utilize the Requests panel if they would like Elders to reserve a task that would normally be trashed.

# Task Requests

If you'd like a task that is normally trashed, please let us know on the Discord server (preferred) utilizing the Requests panel.  We will try our best to not trash it but please keep in mind that mistakes happen.

# General Strategy

Higher level players should do their best to take higher level tasks.  For example, instead of taking a Sugar Cane task, grab the Garlic task.  Both take 30 minutes to grow but the latter can be performed by players at level 60 or above.
