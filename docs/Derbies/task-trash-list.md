Since each derby type has it's own set of quirks, this page lists tasks that are trashed.

- Any task that is less than 320 points
- "Picnic Basket" tasks where more than one activity must be performed
- Fishing Tasks
- Wool Collection and related tasks (e.g. Sweater, Wooly Hat, etc.)
- Tasks where you must be Level 31 or higher (Please refer to the [Goods List](https://hayday.fandom.com/wiki/Goods_List) to review which items these may be)
  - Goat Milk collection tasks

To keep the board diverse with different tasks, we'll limit the following to just one task on the board:
- Boat Tasks
- Truck Delivery Tasks

Some derbies require us to coordinate our actions so be sure to look out for that.

The Elders are often mindful of game events and adjust tasks accordingly.  If you'd like a task that is normally trashed, please let us know.

# Town Tasks

Generally speaking, tasks associated with The Town are kept.  In previous derbies, individual town visitor tasks (e.g. Dancer, Strongman, Teacher, etc.) were trashed.  However, as more participants start opening up the Town, they have been left open.  

Instead, these tasks are often trashed if tasks stay up for more than a day.

# Task Requests

If you'd like a task that is normally trashed, please let us know on the Discord server (perferred) or in-game chat.  We will try our best to not trash it but please keep in mind that mistakes happen.
