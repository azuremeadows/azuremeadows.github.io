**Note:** Effective: January 9, 2024

Since each derby type has it's own set of quirks, this page lists tasks that are generally trashed.  If there are events or if the derby type requires the completion of a task noted below, the elders will make this announcement in the Discord server.

- Any task that is less than 320 points
- Items that take longer than 4 hours to produce (e.g. Tomatoes, Strawberries, etc)
- Goods produced on machines (e.g. pies, juice, bread, smoothies)
- "Picnic Basket" tasks where more than one activity must be performed
- Tasks that remain on the board for 16-24 hours (See details below)
- Town Service Building tasks (e.g. Serve 16 people in the Grocery Store)
- Individual Townie Tasks (e.g. Serve 9 Actresses)

To keep the board diverse with different tasks, we'll limit other tasks not removed to just one.  Multiple copies of popular tasks like Wheat, Mining, Town Visitor, etc. will continue to remain on the board until an Elder thinks they aren't being taken fast enough.

Neighbors are strongly encouraged to utilize the Requests panel if they would like Elders to reserve a task that would normally be trashed.

# Task Requests

If you'd like a task that is normally trashed, please let us know on the Discord server (preferred) utilizing the Requests panel.  We will try our best to not trash it but please keep in mind that mistakes happen.

# General Strategy

Higher level players should do their best to take higher level tasks.  For example, instead of taking a Sugar Cane task, grab the Garlic task.  Both take 30 minutes to grow but the latter can be performed by players at level 60 or above.

Some tasks are **very** popular such as wheat, mining, and town visitor tasks.  We ask you to request reservations on these only if you are prepared to complete it quickly.  

For town visitor tasks specifically, it has been noted that HayDay tends to limit specific types of visitors if there is a task active.  e.g. if you have a Lady task, you'll find they don't come as frequently on your or your neighbors' trains.  So it's often best to have all of them queued before taking the task.

Some derbies require us to coordinate our actions so be sure to look out for that.  This is especially true for Bingo derbies so please watch the announcements channel for that.

## 24-hour Trash

Timezones and other factors will make this rule challenging.  The goal of this rule is to ensure tasks on the board are things people want to complete.  So it will be really important that if you are prepping for a task overnight, you let us know so we don't trash it.  Trashing these task will occur without notice and the elders aren't keeping track of when tasks land on the board.

We have elders scattered around the world and think that enough of us will catch a task that's been around for a while.
