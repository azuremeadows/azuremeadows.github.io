We are a chatty neighborhood, spending most of our time in our Discord server.  Once you join our neighborhood, you will be given an invite to the server where you will be asked to set your server nickname to your farm name.  If you need help, just ask an elder.

While joining the Discord server is completely optional, it's highly recommended as it is often the best way to strategize, get farm help, as well as chat about your hatrid of triple harvest events.

Below is a list of team norms that describe the overall feel and behavior of the neighborhood.  They aren't hard and fast rules but should give you an idea of what we expect from potential recruits as well as from existing neighbors.

- Communication is key:  If you need to take time off from the game or if you're having trouble completing a derby task, **ASK**.  Staying silent for the entire week only to come alive in the last 6 hours of a derby won't help you and it won't help us.  Let us know you need help or if you can't play due to something going on in your life.  Real Life is more important than a game but we can't read your mind.
- Derby Participation is OPTIONAL:  We don't expect everyone to participate in the derby.  But if you do, please read [the Derby Rules]({% link Derbies/rules.md %}) before opting in.  The elders perform a Full Opt-Out every Monday so you must opt in each derby.
- Derby is for rewards, not for ladder climbers:  We've been in the Champions League for some time now.  We strive to finish in the top 3, but we aren't in it to climb the leaderboard.  While we are dedicated to the derby, we're not going to push ourselves to climb higher and higher up the ranks.
- Playing the game is required:  We perform activity checks regularly.  Inactive players may get kicked from the neighborhood if they are inactive for too long.  If you are travelling or you just need a break, let us know and we'll hold your spot.  If you stop playing the game completely, let us know.

Starting 6/21/2022, all neighborhood members must participate in at a derby at least once every two months.

# Activity Checks

From time to time, neighborhood elders will check all neighbors to ensure they are still active in the game.  This is done by going to each farm and making sure that there is some level of farm activity present on the farm.  This check, however, can be biased as they are performed by people who are awake during daylight hours of the Eastern Time Zone (UTC-5).  Here are examples of things we check:

- Actively participating in the derby
- Crops, trees, and bushes in growing phase, NOT harvest phase
- Production Machines running

Farms that are suspected of being inactive will be notified via Discord and the in-game elder chat channel.  Players then have one week to notify the elders that they are still playing the game.  Players who fail to do so will receive a strike.

If a farm receives two inactivity strikes in a row, they may get kicked from the neighborhood out of concern that they are no longer playing the game.
