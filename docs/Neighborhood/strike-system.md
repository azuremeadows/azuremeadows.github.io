The elders enforces the neighborhood rules by using the 3-Strike System.  Neighbors that aren't active or break a derby rule receive a strike.  These strikes expire three months after they are issued.

If a neighbor receives 3 strikes, they are kicked from the neighborhood.

The elders reserve the right to kick neighbors for very clear violations or as a way to maintain order due to gross transgressions.
